To use this bot on your own server, you need to:
  1. Register a Discord application, add a bot to it, and add the bot to your server. Some helpful instructions (with screenshots) are available in **Step 2** of [this blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20220429161834/https://www.alpharithms.com/how-to-code-a-discord-bot-in-javascript-444917/).
  2. Remix/fork this server. You should see a remix button somewhere on this page.
  3. Add a variable in the `.env` file (in the side bar) called `DISCORD_TOKEN` and put your Discord bot's token as the value. The above blog post has info on where to find your bot's token.
  4. Read [these instructions](https://discord.com/channels/970057744612724746/970057745665499148/970317365755654144) on how to use the bot.
